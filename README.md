## How to Setup for coders
This [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/0-S5a0eXPoc) helps a lot with the environment setup and explaining some of the code used in react.

________________________________________________________
### Environment setup 
- Open a terminal 
- Type command **node -v** and check if you are running node v12 or higher *(you can download using this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/))* 
- Type command **npm i –g expo-cli** or if you are on Linux type **sudo npm i –g expo-cli** *(this takes a while to download and ignore all the warnings it gives you)*
- To test out the pages on a physical device, download **Expo Client** on your app store. 
- Make sure you have vscode and are signed into GitHub (there’s a person icon on the bottom left of vscode where you can log into your GitHub). 
________________________________________________________
### Code setup
- Create an empty folder using your terminal or file explorer where you want to have this project.  
- Open a terminal. 
- **cd** into the empty folder you created. 
- Clone the repository with the following command in your terminal: **git clone https://github.com/om185041/NCR_Hackathon.git**
- Open the **NCR_Hackathon** folder in vscode   
- In VScode download the following extension: 
  - React Native Tools by Microsoft
  - React-Native/React/Redux snippets by EQuimper 
________________________________________________________
### Github setup + example
- Your repository should be up to date but if it isn’t you can type the command into the vscode terminal **git pull**
- Go to your branch with your name. To do this you click on the icon at the bottom left and a dropdown should appear. Click on your respective branch **origin/<your_name>**
- Your repository should be up to date but if it isn’t you can type the command into the vscode terminal git pull 
- Go to your branch with your name. To do this you click on the icon at the bottom left  and a dropdown should appear. Click on your respective branch origin/”your_name”
- Now that you are on your branch, go to the README.md and add your name under **Team Members** 
- You should be able to see you made changes in source control *(located on the left side bar)*
- Stage your changes by clicking the **+** that appears when you hover over **Changes** or when you hover over the specific change 
- Enter a message where it says Message and Commit your changes 
- Now you can **Sync Changes** and it should update your branch on the [github page](https://github.com/om185041/NCR_Hackathon/tree/main) 
________________________________________________________
### How to update origin/main + example
- Note: Before you make a pull request make sure that your branch is up to date with any new changes made recently
- Go to [Pull requests](https://github.com/om185041/NCR_Hackathon/pulls) and click the green **New pull request button**
- Make sure that you are making a pull request to base:main from compare:<yourBranch>
- Click **Create pull request** and you should be able to give your pull request a title and description. Just explain what changes you made, in this instance it would be “added name under Team Members” 
- Click **Create pull request**
- Now there should be a pull request to update main with your branch [here](https://github.com/om185041/NCR_Hackathon/pulls). Now you can merge the pull request but it is good practice to get approval from at least 1 or 2 other team members so we can make sure our code isn’t going to affect someone else’s code. We also have to be careful if multiple people are merging at the same time so be sure to let everyone know.  
________________________________________________________
### How to run the project
- Go to the project and **cd RewardsApp**
- Run the frontend using either of the following commands: 
  - npm start *(you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below)* 
  - npm run android 
  - npm run ios *(requires an iOS device or macOS for access to an iOS simulator)*
  - npm run web *(opens up local host) *
- Note: I added “ExampleScreen!” from RewardsApp/app/screens/ExampleScreen.tsx to see how it would call it. I am trying to keep everything organized. We can add whatever folders we need to the **app** folder.
